            Please set out what you estimate as the post 16 publicly funded enrolments for your qualification, from 2025 to 2026 funding year.  A space is provided below for you to give this information by funding year if you want to provide information for multiple years. 
            
            Estimated number of publicly funded enrolments are enrolments that you estimate are publicly funded through 16 to 19 study programmes, adult education budget (ESFA funded or devolved to mayoral combined authorities and the Greater London Authority) and/or advanced learner loans. 
            
            To produce your estimates, you can use information about post 16 publicly funded enrolments on an existing qualification if it will be replaced by your new qualification. If you are using information from existing qualifications, please use information from the last funding year. 
            
            Uploading supporting evidence 
            
            Please review the submitting evidence section below and upload supporting evidence into Galaxkey. Please do not include personal student data. 
            
             Evidence must be from institutions that have an ESFA funding agreement. For the adult education budget, we will also accept evidence from institutions that are contracted to deliver the adult education budget devolved to mayoral combined authorities and the Greater London Authority. Evidence must be in the form of letters from institutions and be on headed paper.   
            
            You can see which institutions are funded by the ESFA using the allocations spreadsheets: 
            
            • 19+ allocations sheet shows funding values for institutions who have a contract to deliver the adult education budget or advanced learner loans - Funding allocations to training providers: 2022 to 2023 
            • 16 to 19 allocations sheet shows institutions which receive core programme funding: 16 to 19 allocation data: 2022 to 2023 academic year  
            
            Evidence can include more than one qualification, but for each qualification the letter must clearly list the qualification title (as it is in the submission form), the publicly funded enrolments and how the enrolments breakdown by funding year and funding streams (16 to 19 study programmes, skills fund and/or advanced learner loans). 
            
            Evidence submitted needs to demonstrate at least 100 publicly funded enrolments, unless you are also submitting evidence as part of question 2 that shows that enrolments will be less than 100 enrolments. We recognise that there may be circumstances where enrolments may not be 100 or more in each year once the qualification is established, for example the qualification supports progression into a highly specialist area or into an occupation where there is occupational demand.

Where you are thinking of developing a suite of qualifications like this, please be aware that each qualification must have a clear purpose and deliver meaningful outcomes as a standalone qualification. For example, each qualification in the suite will need to support entry to HE to be approved as an AAQ and will also need to meet Ofqual qualification level conditions for AAQs.
