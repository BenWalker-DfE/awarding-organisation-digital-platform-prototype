      Funding a new qualification </h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You have told us that you are applying for funding for a new qualification.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You must submit letters from institutions that show the qualification will have at least 100 publicly funded
        enrolments and which funding year and funding stream those enrolments relate to.

        The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualifications-funding-approval-manual-2025-to-2026/common-funding-approval-criteria">Qualifications Funding Approval Manual</a> sets out what needs to be included in the letters and
        explains how you can check whether the institution is in receipt of publicly funded enrolments.
